## Exercise🏃‍

I try to get 4 hours of exercise, 2 days a week.  I mostly walk, run, and ride bycicle (which is the most unlike-me thing, but it’s actually kinda fun). 

While working, often get up, strech yourself, move your eyes around.

## Living your free time⚽

Try to do things that are not related to programming. Try to find things that you enjoy, like reading a book, cooking, drawing, painting or [something else](https://content.wisestep.com/things-to-do-in-your-free-time/).

## Eating🍎

As always, avoid junk food if possible. If you get hungry while working, you should get yourself some fruit or whole grain cookies. 

If you have time you can make yourself some [snacks](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/photos/50-quick-snack-recipes)
