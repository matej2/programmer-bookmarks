## Exercise🏃‍

I try to get 4 hours of exercise, 2 days a week.  I mostly walk, run, and ride bycicle (which is the most unlike-me thing, but it’s actually kinda fun). 

While working, often get up, strech yourself, move your eyes around.

## Living your free time⚽

Try to do things that are not related to programming. Try to find things that you enjoy.
