## ExerciseüèÉ‚Äç

I try to get 4 hours of exercise, 2 days a week.  I mostly walk, run, and ride bycicle (which is the most unlike-me thing, but it‚Äôs actually kinda fun). 

While working, often get up, strech yourself, move your eyes around.

[Here](https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/4-types-of-exercise/) are some details to choose your exercise type

## Living your free time‚öΩ

Try to do things that are not related to programming. Try to find things that you enjoy, like reading a book, cooking, drawing, painting or [something else](https://content.wisestep.com/things-to-do-in-your-free-time/).

## Eatingüçé

As always, avoid junk food if possible. If you get hungry while working, you should get yourself some fruit or whole grain cookies. 

If you have time you can make yourself some [snacks](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/photos/50-quick-snack-recipes).

Summary: 
* Avoid fried/or fast/heavily processed foods at all costs.
* You should typically avoid anything made with white flour (bread, pasta, cereals etc.). Instead, choose 100% whole wheat or whole grain options.
* Keep a glass of water (or better a jug) on your desk. Drink plenty of water. It‚Äôs better to be over-hydrated than dehydrated.
* Get to know GI values of main products and eat carbs with GI values lower than 70 throughout the day.
* Pass up the candies, cakes, sweets, and alcohol as much as possible as they‚Äôre not good for your brain function.
* Buy high-quality fish oil with high DHA, EPA. Also, a good multivitamin.

I calculated how many calories I need per day and I started tracking them. I made sure I didn't eat too much as well as making sure I didn't eat too little. I cut out all processed and fast food from my diet. No more frozen pizzas, microwave burgers or refrigerated sandwiches. I started eating whole foods.

A trail mix is a good snack. It has a lot of micro nutrients as well as all of the macro nutrients. Consume something in the morning. For me the best thing is some oatmeal with some nuts, fruits and some protein powder. A lot of people also like the bulletproof coffee.

Take brakes for lunch. Taking a brake from work to have lunch will give your brain a chance to take a brake. Preparing a meal can be quite meditative. It will also give you a chance to catch up with some co workers on what they are doing.

Eat your veggies. If you don't want to do a lot of research on which veggies have which vitamins: A good rule of thumb is to eat many different colours. Carrots and broccoli are a good start. ([source](https://www.quora.com/What-food-do-programmers-eat-for-their-brain-to-get-sharp))

If you want to try some diets, try [ketonic diet](https://medium.com/kkempin/best-diet-for-developers-8452daa63868).

Programmers live a very sedentary lifestyle, and thus the main problem isn‚Äôt usually overeating. The fact that you are not moving, exercising, or eating as well as others, further contributes towards having a strict diet plan. For those who are active, having a larger intake of food can be possible without gaining weight. But that‚Äôs not the case for most programmers. [Here](http://www.indianic.com/blog/general/the-best-food-for-programmers.html) are some food options programmers are bound to relish.

If you eat smarter, the healthy food you put into your body can actually act as a brain booster and might just improve your workplace performance. Need lunch ideas for work, or some healthy snacks to stock up on? [These foods](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/brain-foods-stay-focused-0717)  can help keep your brain at its prime.
